            <p>
                Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the central processing unit (CPU),
                random-access memory (RAM), motherboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, and computer
                case. It includes external devices such as a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and speakers. By contrast,
                software is a set of written instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware derived its
                name from the fact it is hard or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is soft because it is
                easy to change. Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A
                combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with
                only hardware.

                <h2>Input/output</h2>
                <p>Most computers also have an external data bus to connect peripheral devices to the motherboard. Most
                    commonly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB" target="_blank">Universal Serial Bus (USB)</a> is used. Unlike the internal bus, the external bus is connected
                    using a bus controller that allows the peripheral system to operate at a different speed from the
                    CPU. Input and output devices are used to receive data from the external world or write data
                    respectively. Common examples include keyboards and mice (input) and displays and printers (output).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller" target="_blank">
                    Network interface controllers</a> are used to access the Internet. USB ports also allow power to
                    connected devices—a standard USB supplies power at 5 volts and up to 500 milliamps (2.5 watts),
                    while powered USB ports with additional pins may allow the delivery of more power—up to 6 amps at
                    24v.</p>

            <h2>Case</h2>

            <p>A computer case encloses most of the components of a desktop computer system. It provides mechanical
                support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard, disk drives, and power supply, and
                controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components. The case is also part of the
                system to control electromagnetic interference radiated by the computer and protects internal parts from
                electrostatic discharge. Large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_tower" target="_blank">tower cases</a> provide space for multiple disk drives or other peripherals
                and usually stand on the floor, while desktop cases provide less expansion room. All-in-one style
                designs include a video display built into the same case. Portable and laptop computers require cases
                that provide impact protection for the unit. Hobbyists may decorate the cases with colored lights,
                paint, or other features, in an activity called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_modding" target="_blank">case modding.</a></p>
